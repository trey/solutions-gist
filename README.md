# The History of Trey's Solutions Log.

The original idea for doing this came from the book [Practices of an Agile Developer](http://pragmaticprogrammer.com/titles/pad/).

I started it sometime in 2006 as a WordPress blog on DreamHost. In that form, I moved it to Slicehost and then to WebFaction. On Webfaction, I converted it to Octopress. That still turned out to be a bit too much friction. Now I've started using [Gist](https://gist.github.com/trey)s for this purpose. Most things I try to keep track of, I just create a [Notational](http://notational.net/)/[Simplenote](http://simplenoteapp.com/) note.

I've made a point to move over the most popular and (what I find to be) most helpful posts. The rest can be found in [the Octopress repository](https://github.com/trey/solutions).
